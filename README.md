ðŸš€Project Overview:

This project is built around the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, providing a solid foundation for understanding abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. At its heart, it features an abstract Employee class that serves as the blueprint for different employee types. This class defines common attributes and behaviors that are shared by all employee types, such as name, id, and calculateSalary().

The project further demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism through its concrete subclasses, FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee, which extend the Employee class. Each subclass implements its own salary calculation logic, showcasing how different employee types can have their own unique implementations while sharing common behaviors.


ðŸš€Key Features:

Abstract Employee class that defines shared behaviors and attributes.

Subclasses (FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee) with custom salary calculation methods.

Clear demonstration of OOP principles: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

Intuitive terminal interface for easy data entry, manipulation, and salary computation.
